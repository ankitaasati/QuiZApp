QUIZAPP contains three main modules: 

Quiz, Review, and Result. 

The quiz section of the online test application accepts the questions in JSON format. 
The JSON file can be easily shared from the server in the pre-defined format. 
The application renders the test at the client-side.
The “Review and display result” section allows users to declare the results immediately.
